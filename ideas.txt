Limit which special modes can be used?
More level meta-data options
come up with a better name (stupid acronym?) for special (cos thats kinda a fallout thing)


Levels plan:

10 normal levels, each increasing in difficulty

2 levels dedicated to each special mode (eg. introduce frenzy mode, and have the player walk through a wall)
2 level after each two using the one just learnt and another in conjuction
1 boss fight with multiple modes

10 more levels that use all the special modes
1 boss fight

GLaDOS vibe?

Boss fight ideas:
use dudes to battle boss - more dudes merged at once that hit him do exponentially more damage to his health? with dudes regenning - but boss can randomly kill dudes, so do you wait for more and take the risk, or slowly deal damage



Start of EA:
No bosses, no voice-over.

End of EA:
More levels, more bosses
